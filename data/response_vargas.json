    "description": "The exhilarating new Inspector Adamsberg novel from France’s multi-million copy bestselling queen of crime ‘Adamsberg is one of my favourite detectives... I so enjoyed This Poison Will Remain’ ANN CLEEVES When three elderly men are poisoned, apparently by spider bites, everyone assumes that the deaths are tragic accidents. But at police headquarters in Paris, Inspector Adamsberg begins to suspect that the case is far more complex than first appears. It isn’t long before Adamsberg is pursuing a series of rumours and allegations that take him to the south of France, and the shocking events that occurred at La Miséricorde orphanage, decades ago. A spate of serious injuries there was linked to bites from the same local species, the recluse spider. Adamsberg is convinced that, through the haunting crimes of the past, he can prove that the men were victims of an ingenious serial killer. His team, however, is not so sure. This time, he must put his reputation on the line to trace the murderer before the death toll rises...",

But a strange symbol found at the crime scene leads the local police to call Commissaire Adamsberg and his team. When the symbol is found near the body of a second disguised suicide, a pattern begins to emerge: both victims were part of a disastrous expedition to Iceland over ten years ago where a group of tourists found themselves trapped on a deserted island for two weeks, surrounded by a thick, impenetrable fog rumored to be summoned by an ancient local demon. Two of them didn’t make it back alive. But how are the deaths linked to the secretive Association for the Study of the Writings of Maximilien Robespierre?
