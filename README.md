## Welcome to MyBookQ

The mission of this project is to provide me the latest information on the books published my favorite authors and also provide me with new books written by new authors (to me) that share similar traits with my favorite book series.

#### Data Acquistion & Processing

- [Shiny App](https://alicia.shinyapps.io/author_search/) to interactively search for authors and view upcoming book descriptions
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/aliciatb/mybookq/blob/master/notebooks/get_books_by_author.ipynb) for Exploratory Analysis
